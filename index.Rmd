You will learn to use various analytics tools and programming languages during your study at Rotman. Below is an incomplete list of them together with download links and getting-started resources. 

### Python 3

Python is a general purpose high-level programming language. It has a large collection of data science packages to help maximize your productivity in data analytics tasks.

1. Install Python 3

    Many distributions of Python are available. Among them, Anaconda is a major Python distribution popular among data scientists. Choose one of the download links below depending on your need.
    * [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual){target="_blank"} comes with many Python data science packages preinstalled (e.g numpy and pandas). It also includes a package and environment management system (called conda), a Jupyter Notebook setup, and Python developement tools (Spyder and Pycharm). It even includes R and RStudio.
    * [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html){target="_blank"} is a minimal install of Anaconda. It only includes conda, core Python, and a small number of useful Python packages.
    
2. Install a Code Editor

    Many code editors work well with Python. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target="_blank"} with its [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python){target="_blank"} is one of the best. 
    
3. Get-started Resources
    * Learn the Python language: [Python Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2){target="_blank"} (login from [here](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/linkit/lyndacom-online-courses){target="_blank"} using UTORid for free access).
    * Learn programming (using Python): [Learn to Program: The Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program){target="_blank"} (For free access, click "Enroll for Free" and then choose the "Full Course, No Certificate" option.)
    * Learning Python data science skills: [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/){target="_blank"}.
    
### R

R is a programming language for statistical computing. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, â€¦) and graphical techniques.

1. Download R from [R-project](https://cloud.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}.

2. Install [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/){target="_blank"}, the best R development environment.

3. Get-started Resources
    * [R beginner learning path](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/){target="_blank"} from RStudio Education.
    * [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/){target="_blank"}.

### SQL

SQL is a database query language. 

1. Installation

    To use SQL, you typically need to install a database management system (DBMS). Lightweight DBMSs are most suitable for desktop/laptop installation. We recommend you two options.
    
    * [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html){target="_blank"} (DBMS) and its GUI management client [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/){target="_blank"}.
    * [Microsoft SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads){target="_blank"}, a mini-versin of MS SQL Server (<span style="color: red;">important:</span> download the **Express** version), and its GUI management client [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms){target="_blank"} (SSMS).
    
2. Get-started Resources

    * SQLite: [Learning SQL Programming by Scott Simpson](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-sql-programming){target="_blank"} (login from [here](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/linkit/lyndacom-online-courses){target="_blank"} using UTORid for free access).
    * MS SQL Server Express: [Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2019](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/querying-microsoft-sql-server-2019){target="_blank"} (login from [here](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/linkit/lyndacom-online-courses){target="_blank"} using UTORid for free access).
    
### JMP

JMP is a suite of computer programs for statistical analysis developed by the JMP business unit of SAS Institute.

1. Download JMP from [Rotman Hub](https://hub.rotman.utoronto.ca/){target="_blank"} (click the "Software" tile, and then follow the SAS "Download" link. The JMP download link is under the "JMP" tab).

2. Get-started Resources
